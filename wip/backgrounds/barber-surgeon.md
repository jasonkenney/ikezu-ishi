## How have you "improved" yourself? Roll 1d6:

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | You have a replacement eye that can magnify objects, act as a telescope, and has minimal night vision. You cannot wear anything metal on your head, and the presence of strong magnets make you _deprived_.                                            |
| **2** | One foot is mostly metal (kick, d6), and you treat some [tough](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/wilderness-exploration/#terrain-difficulty) terrain as **Easy**. Carry a **can of oil** (6 uses). Without a daily application you are _deprived_ and noisy. |
| **3** | One of your fingers has been swapped, the bone replaced by gold and iron. Take a **hook** and a **screwdriver** that attaches to the fingertip.                                                                                                              |
| **4** | Both ears have been surgically enhanced, tripling your hearing ability. You can focus on a specific sound at a great distance, such as a conversation. You wear an ear flap to protect against sudden loud noises (WIL save to avoid temporary paralysis). |
| **5** | Your chest is lined with alchemical sigils, toughening the skin (Armor 1). Wearing other metallic armor nullifies the effect.                                                                                                                    |
| **6** | One arm is fully metal, and comes off at the shoulder. It can be used as a weapon (d8, _bulky_ when not attached) and can move independently if you are within sight of it.                                                                                           |

## What rare tool is essential to your work? Roll 1d6:

|       |                    |                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **1** | **Regrowth Salve** | Regrows a body part over the course of a day.                                   |
| **2** | **Graftgrub**      | A small worm that can fuse inanimate objects with parts of the body.  1 use.                                                                                         |
| **3** | **Woundwax**       | Heals wounds from fire or chemicals (restoring full STR), but nothing else. 2 uses.                                                                                   |
| **4** | **Quicksilver**    | A stimulant. Go first in combat, and automatically pass any WIL saves for one hour. _Addictive_: Save STR or become _deprived_ after 24 hours without it. 4 uses. |
| **5** | **Pneuma Pump**    | Portable iron lungs (_bulky_). Enables life-saving surgery or underwater breathing.                                                                                 |
| **6** | **Lodestone**      | Draws out dangerous elements from the body and acts as a powerful magnetic force.                                                                                   |
