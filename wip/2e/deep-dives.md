# Deep Dives

## Wilderness Exploration

### Time & Travel Duration

Travel time in Cairn is counted in Watches, divided into three eight-hour segments per day. However, as most parties elect to spend the third Watch of the day resting, one can use "Days" as a shorthand for travel. For example, if the distance between two points is equal to four Watches, the party would need to travel for two Days, arriving in the evening of the second day. 

To determine the distance between two points, combine the penalties from both **Path** and **Terrain** types. Consult the [Terrain](#terrain-difficulty) and [Path Difficulty](#path-difficulty) tables to determine the appropriate penalty to travel. For instance, if two **points** on the map are connected by a forest trail, the total travel distance would be 3 Watches (+1 Watch for the winding trail and +2 Watches for the _Tough_ wooded terrain). 

Traveling by a maintained road incurs _no_ penalties to travel, while trails add one Watch to the journey. Traveling through the wilderness _always_ adds two Watches. For travel via waterways, refer to the surrounding terrain difficulty. Include penalties from any changes in paths or terrain along the route, and for longer journeys add up to +3 Watches. Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party's travel speed or even negate certain penalties. 

### Path Difficulty

| **Path**   | **Penalty** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Roads      | +0 Watches  |
| Trails     | +1 Watch    |
| Wilderness | +2 Watches  |

### Terrain Difficulty

|                |                                 |             |                          |                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Difficulty** | **Terrain**                     | **Penalty** | **Odds of Getting Lost** | **Examples**                                                                                          |
| **Easy**       | **Plains, grasslands, valleys** | +1 Watch    | None                     | _Safe areas for rest, fellow travelers, good visibilities_                                            |
| **Tough**      | **Forests, deserts, hills**     | +2 Watches  | 2-in-6                   | _Wild animals, flooding, broken equipment, falling rocks, unsafe shelters, hunter's traps_            |
| **Perilous**   | **Mountains, jungle, swamp**    | +3 Watches  | 4-in-6                   | _Quicksand, sucking mud, choking vines, unclean water, poisonous plants and animals, poor navigation_ |


### Creating a Pointcrawl

- Number any potential points of interest on the map.
- Identify potential routes between each point, noting obvious roads and trails. Indicate any sites that lack connecting routes to other points. 
- Indicate the rough travel time (in days) between any two points, accounting for the party's speed, terrain, weather, and other elements of play that might affect the journey. 

#### Pointcrawl Example

[![Alt text](/img/2e/pointcrawl_example.jpg "Click to embiggen"){:height="60%" width="60%"}](/img/2e/pointcrawl_example.jpg)

The travel times between each point were determined as follows (assuming that the party is travelling by foot):
- The journey between points **1** to **2** is 6 watches:  
  - Add one watch for the trail through the mountains and forests.
  - Add three watches for the _Perilous_ mountain terrain, and 2 watches for the forest.
- The journey between **2** and **3** takes 4 watches:
  - Add one watch for the trail through the mountains.
  - Add three watches for the _Perilous_ mountain terrain.
- The journey between **2** and **4** takes three watches:
  - No penalty for traveling on a maintained road.
  - Add two watches for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
  - Add one additional watch for the _extra long_ forest journey.
- The journey between **4** and **5** takes four watches: 
  - Add one watch for the trail through the swamp.
  - Add one watch for the _Perilous_ swamp terrain.
- The journey between **4** and **6** takes 3 watches:
  - Add one watch for the trail through the woods.
  - Add two watches for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
- The journey to **7** from anywhere should consider:
  -  +2 for traveling through the wilderness
  -  +2 for traveling through the _Tough_ forest terrain.
  -  +1 watch if traveling from further away.
