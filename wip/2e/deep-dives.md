# Deep Dives

## Wilderness Exploration

### Time & Travel Duration

Travel time in Cairn is counted in watches, divided into three eight-hour segments per day. However, as most parties elect to spend the third watch of the day resting, one can use "days" as a shorthand for travel. For example, if the distance between two points is equal to four watches, the party would need to travel for two days, arriving in the evening of the second day.

Traveling by maintained road incurs no penalties to travel, while trails add one watch. Traveling through the wilderness always adds _two_ watches. Rivers are treated as trails (provided the party has a boat). The party only incurs penalties for the _most difficult_ terrain they pass through. Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party's travel speed or even overcome other penalties. 

To determine the distance between two points, combine the **Path** and **Terrain** type penalties. For example, if two **points** on the map are connected by a forest road, the total travel distance would be 2 **Watches** (+0 Watches for the road and +2 Watches for the **Tough** terrain). 

### Terrain Difficulty

|      |      |      |      |      |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Difficulty** | **Terrain** | **Penalty** | **Odds of Getting Lost** | **Examples**                                                                                          |
| **Easy**              | **Plains, grasslands, valleys** | +1 Watch           | None                     | _Smooth roads, safe areas for rest, fellow travelers_                                                |
| **Tough**             | **Forests, deserts, hills** | +2 Watches           | 2-in-6                   | _Wild animals, flooding, broken equipment, falling rocks, unsafe shelters, hunter's traps_            |
| **Perilous**          | **Mountains, jungle, swamp** | +3 Watches         | 4-in-6                   | _Quicksand, sucking mud, choking vines, unclean water, poisonous plants and animals, poor navigation_ |

### Weather Difficulty

|                  |                                                                                                 |                                                           |
| :--------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **Weather**    | **Effect**                                                                                      | **Examples**                                              |
|     **Nice**     | Favorable conditions for travel.                                                                | _Clear skies, sunny_                                      |
|     **Fair**     | Favorable conditions for travel.                                                                | _Overcast, breezy_                                        |
|  **Unpleasant**  | Add a **Fatigue** _or_ add one **watch** to the journey.                                        | _Gusting winds, rain showers, sweltering heat, chill air_ |
|  **Inclement**   | Add a **Fatigue** _or_ add one **watch** to the journey. **Difficulty** increases by one step.  | _Thunderstorms & lightning, rain, muddy ground_           |
|   **Extreme**    | Add a **Fatigue** _and_ add one **watch** to the journey. **Difficulty** increases by one step. | _Blizzards, freezing winds, flooding, mud slides_         |
| **Catastrophic** | Most parties cannot travel under these conditions.                                              | _Tornados, tidal waves, hurricane, volcanic eruption_     |

### Creating a Pointcrawl

- Number any potential points of interest on the map.
- Identify potential routes between each point, noting obvious roads and trails. Indicate any sites that lack connecting routes to other points. 
- Indicate the rough travel time (in days) between any two points, accounting for the party's speed, terrain, weather, and other elements of play that might affect the journey. 

#### Pointcrawl Example

[![Alt text](/img/2e/pointcrawl_example.jpg "Click to embiggen"){:height="60%" width="60%"}](/img/2e/pointcrawl_example.jpg)

The travel times between each point were determined as follows (assuming that the party is travelling by foot):
- The journey between points **1** to **2** takes 4 watches (two days):  
  - Add one watch for the trail through the mountains and grasslands.
  - Add three watches for the _Perilous_ mountain terrain.
- The journey between **2** and **4** takes two watches:
  - No penalty for traveling on a maintained road.
  - Add two watches for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
- The journey between **4** and **6** takes one watch: 
  - No penalty for traveling on a maintained road.
  - Add one watch for the _Easy_ countryside terrain.
- The journey between **4** and **5** takes 3 watches:
  - Add one watch for the trail through the woods.
  - Add two watches for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
- The journey to **3** from the nearest adjacent points:
  -  +2 for traveling an untrodden path.
  -  +2 for traveling through the _Tough_ forest terrain.
