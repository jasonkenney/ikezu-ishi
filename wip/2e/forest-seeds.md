# Forest Seeds

## Forestcrawls

A forestcrawl is a simple method for exploring a large forested area, typically made up of branching trails connecting scattered points of interest. While a forestcrawl has some of the same properties as a traditional dungeon delve, it swaps stone walls and ceilings for the dense, non-linear design of a heavily wooded area. Instead of rooms, points of interest are defined as clearings or major changes in the forested landscape. However unlike exploring a dungeon, characters can go take shortcuts, go "off-trail," or climb trees to get a better look ahead (with a cost, of course).   

### Exploring The Wood

- Follow the _Dungeon_ exploration procedures found in the Player's Guide, but rather than rolling for Dungeon Events, use the Wilderness Events table instead.
- If the party attempts to step off the trail and cut through the forest, the Warden should make any associated costs clear. Added travel time, effort, special tools that may be required, and any obvious dangers. Going off-trail also automatically triggers a roll on the Wilderness Events table.
- Points in a forestcrawl are close to each other. When traveling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (10-15 POIs) can be explored in its entirety in a single Watch.
- Rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much daylight is available, whether a suitable area is available for rest, and what the costs or dangers associated nighttime exploration may be. 

## Creating a Forest

Follow this procedure for any forested terrain in a region. 

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is fine.
- Pencils and erasers. Colored pencils or crayons are good, too.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### Overview

1. Define the forest.
2. Define the forest's inhabitants.
3. Create points.
4. Create the trails.
5. Create forest encounters.
6. Name the forest.

## Forest Description

Roll on the [Forest Description](#forest-description) and write the results in your notebook. This table both indicates how outsiders perceive the forest as well as any unique natural features it may have. If the forested terrain was generated using the methods described in the Setting Seeds chapter, consider how the associated Landmark affects it as well.

> Landmarks help travelers navigate through the dense foliage, acting as geographic reference points: unusually tall trees, watchtowers, and so on. Most forest landmarks are visible only by climbing a tree, though a few are large enough to stand out from the green. Some landmarks are _heard_ rather than seen.

## The Spirit of the Forest

In some ways the Wood is a single entity, its brain alive within every tree and plant, connected via a network of thorn and branch. The animals and plants are its limbs, directing the wants, desires, fears, and needs. The creatures that live within its boundaries are its blood, answering its call by delivering much needed defenses and rebuffing interlopers. The Wood will always protect itself, and its children. Roll on the [Traits](#traits) and [Forest Agenda](#forest-agenda) tables, writing the results in your notebook. This describes the general attitude of the creatures found in the forest as well as what the forest _wants_ as a whole.

## Create the Map

### Create POIs

- Roll **8-12 d6** dice on the dungeon map, ignoring any dice that fall off the page. These are the Points of Interest (POI) in the forest.
- Write the face-up results on the page according to the [Forest Die Drop Table](#forest-die-drop-table). For example, the number **4** would indicate a **Shelter**, denoted by the letter "S" on the page.
- Select two opposite points, preferably close to the page border. These are the forest's entrance and exit.
- Starting with the entrance and ending at the exit, number each POI on the map.
- Roll on the relevant tables for each point, writing the results in your notebook. 

#### Forest Die Drop Table

| **2-3** | Ruins   |
| **4**   | Shelter |
| **5-6** | Hazard  |

## Trails

### Trail Types

- **Standard** trails are obvious or well-trod routes between two points. _Represented by a thick line._
- **Hidden** trails do not appear on any known maps. Their discovery always requires some kind of cost. _Represented by a dashed line._
- **Conditional** trails may be blocked, or requires specialized tools (boats, climbing gear, etc.) to cross. Others may even be impossible to navigate without a map or guide. _Represented by a crossed line._

### Draw Trails

- Starting with the entrance, draw 1-4 paths between each point.
  - Create loops, branching paths, dead-ends, and shortcuts between points.
  - Some paths are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
  - Some paths are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
  - Create intersections (crossed lines) with no points in between.
- Create trails by drawing over paths that connect 3-4 points in an obvious, consistent, or interesting manner. 
  - Short, isolated paths between points and hidden paths are not usually a part of a trail.
  - Use colored pencils or crayons to help distinguish different trails.
- Roll on the [Trail Types](#trail-types) table for each trail, recording the results in your notebook.

> If some of the results seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn these juxtapositions into questions like "Why _is_ there an old logging road leading to the bandit's hideout?" That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

#### Monster

Monsters are any dangerous creature one might encounter in the forest. This does not mean it will attack intruders by default! Monsters are not "waiting around" for characters to stumble upon them, but have their own wants and goals. Some monsters can talk, reason, and even beg for mercy. _People can be monsters, too_.

#### Shelter

#### Hazard

The Wood is a dangerous place, and not to be trifled with. The forest and its inhabitants do what they must to survive, and even sated are still preparing for their next meal. The trees, the plants, and the earth itself will leave deadly traps and dangers to root out those unworthy to pass beneath the boughs.

## Example Forest

### Map

[![Click Me!](/img/2e/forest-seed-example.webp "Click to embiggen"){:height="60%" width="60%"}](/img/2e/forest-seed-example.webp)

### The Forest

**Description**: Diseased, Frozen

A thick forest infected with disease and rot. Parts of it are frozen solid.

### Denizens

**Traits**: Stable, Invasive

They value stability above all things. They will do whatever it takes - including invading other lands - to maintain that stability.

**Forest Agenda**: Expansion, Fragmentation

The spirit of the forest is bent on expanding the forest's reach to some adjacent lands, but fears that spreading their forces too thin might break their hold over the forest.

### Forest Theme

Looking at our table results (including trails and POIs), we can surmise that this forest was once a peaceful place, mediated by an old witch. After she died her magic lived on, but began poisoning the forest she had once protected. When the weather spell she'd maintained for years became unstable, its disorder began to seep into the trees and plants, and eventually into the forest's inhabitants as well. 

## Trails 

### Old Logging Road, Fresh Spiderwebs. 

The path between **1** and **5** is blocked by a broad cliff face, requiring climbing gear to ascend.  Giant spiders travel the hidden path between **9** and **6**, spinning their web all along the trail.

### Treeline Heights, Stone Piles

The ancient monks at **8** once climbed this path daily to pay their respects in the crystal chambers of **2**. They left piles of stone alongside the path for each of their fallen members.

### Foraging Path, Distant Singing

An old Witch once survived purely from the plentiful fruit on this trail. Her magic has outlived her now, including her obedient two-legged hut, the strange weather in **6**, and the faint sounds of an woman singing a lullaby.

### Dry Riverbed, Tree Carvings

A river once ran through West end of the forest, but dried up after the witch died. Her runes still mar the surface of some trees here.

### Hunter's Track, Peripheral Images

The hermit of **3** still hunts along this trail, obeying the laws of old. He is over 200 years old, and doesn't plan on dying until he's good and ready. Sometimes visions of him as a younger - and happier - man appear along the path, just out of sight. They vanish just as soon as they appear.

### POIs

### 1 - Diseased Campsite

**Ruin**: _Petrified Campsite_, _Overrun with unusual flora_ | **Entrance**

At the forest edge is a dead **campfire** with piles of dark grey **bedding** laid out close by. Plants, flowers, and other **flora** grow thickly over the campsite. A **trail** to the **North** leads into the forest. 

- **Campfire**: No smoke or soot remains. 
  - The remaining wood is stained a deep grey and very cold to the touch. One of the logs is clearly diseased, and is as hard as iron.
- **Bedding**: Stained a dark grey. Splinters of grey wood are stuck in the cloth.
  - Icy cold to the touch. The space beneath the cloth is partly blue and red, but grey circles grow out of the wood flecks. 
- **Flora**: Rare and unique species not common to these parts.
  - Skilled pruning and a few minutes of careful work produces a **Healing Salve** (restore 1d4 STR, 1 use).
- **Trail**: Long grooves in the rough shape of a tree trunk are cut into the ground. 
  - Fine spiderwebs block the forest entry, as if no one had walked through in a long while.


### 2 - 

**Hazard**: _Sap Trap_, _Ghost Trapped in Crystal_



3 - Shelter: Hermit's Hut, Presents a Ready Meal
4 - Shelter: Hut with legs, hunting is forbidden
5 - Monster: Grizzly, prowling
6 - Hazard: Frozen Troll, Highly localized weather
7 - Monster: Skeleton, scouting
8 - Ruins: Flooded monastery, broken portal
9 - Hazard: Giant Spider Nest, bird spies
10 - Shelter: Fishing hut, Occupied by army deserters (Exit)
