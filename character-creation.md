## Roll Ability Scores

**Roll Under System**:

When rolling a save, PCs roll a d20 against an appropriate ability score. If they roll **equal to or under** that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:

  

_Strength (STR) /_ 力 _(Chikara – Power)_

Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

### _Dexterity (DEX) / 躱 (Duo - Evade)_

Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

### _Willpower (WIL) / 志 (Kokorozashi – Will)_    

Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

  

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

## Roll Hit Protection (HP) / 避 (Bi - Avoid)

**Remember:**

HP doesn’t stand for “hit points,” it’s “hit protection.” This reflects a character’s ability to avoid damage, either through speed, guile, strength, or other non-armor means.

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the **Scars** table.

HP can be increased by **Scars** and game play but can never be higher than 3d6.

## Choose a Background

More information is available in the **Backgrounds** chapter (Page 10).

Choose or roll 3d6 against the **Background Table** to determine part of your character’s\` past.

Backgrounds provide flavor to your character. While not a Class, a background helps inform knowledge and skills which may be handy in certain situations. It may also impact interactions within the game.

## Starting Gear

All PCs begin with a kate-bukuro (provision bag) with 6 slots and Starting Gear listed in the character’s **Background**. The Guide may allow players to select gear from the **Equipment Table**.

## Inventory And Equipment

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots:

·     six slots in a kate-bukuro

·     one slot for each hand

·     two slots for their upper body

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Guide's discretion.

·     **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.

·     Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

·     A character cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. **Retainers** can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Finishing Touches

Roll your character’s **Age** (2d20+10).

Players may fill out the rest of their character sheets as they see fit, or by using the following tables. These have no impact on the rules of the game but can be used for further developing characters and by Guides for creating plot threads.
